This page collects the most recent versions of each of the charts, for each
area that I'm tracking.

<h2>Confirmed COVID-19 Cases</h2>

<p>This chart shows the number of confirmed cases over time.  The confirmed case count data comes from the
<a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/">daily updates</a>
from the Florida Division of Emergency Management.  Please see the <a href="/products/number-of-covid19-cases">COVID-19 Dashboard</a>

<h2>Doubling Time in Confirmed COVID-19 Cases</h2>

<p>This chart shows the number of days that it would take for the number of
  confirmed COVID-19 cases to double, at the current rate each day.

<h2>Estimated Number of SARS-CoV-2 Infections</h2>

p>This chart shows a range of estimates for the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections,
  based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.  The range shown in the chart is from
  <a href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html">a
    study</a> estimating the number of infections relative to the number of
    reported cases from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious
    Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  The
    estimated ranges for various countries are updated periodically, and I'm
    using the estimated range for the United States.  I update my charts
    whenever the estimated range is updated.</p>
