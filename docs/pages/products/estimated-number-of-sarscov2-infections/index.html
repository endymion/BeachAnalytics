<p>This chart shows a range of estimates for the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections,
  based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>The range shown in the chart is from
  <a href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html">a
    study</a> estimating the number of infections relative to the number of
    reported cases from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious
    Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.</p>  The
    estimated ranges for various countries are updated periodically, and I'm
    using the estimated range for the United States.  I update my charts
    whenever the estimated range is updated.

<h2>Sources</h2>

The confirmed case count data comes from the
<a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/">daily updates</a>
from the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
