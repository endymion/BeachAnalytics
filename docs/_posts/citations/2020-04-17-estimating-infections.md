## Infection count estimates

Mathematical modelers in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine [found](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html) the U.S.â€™s case count likely represented just 14% to 19% of actual infections, so I'm multiplying the number of cases by five to seven to estimate the number of infections.
