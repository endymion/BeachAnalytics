I started a web site for documenting each product and exposing the most current visualizations.  I want a place where I can explain the basis for any estimation or projection that I'm doing in the visualizations and provide citations.  And I also want a system that will automatically locate the most current image and feature it on a web page.  I'm generating so many images lately that they're difficult to manage.

## Details

The site is based on [Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com)'s excellent [Documentation Theme for Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  The source for the web site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/endymion/BeachCov2/tree/master/web).
