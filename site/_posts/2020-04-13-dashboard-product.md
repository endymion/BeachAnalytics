I've been posting more slowly in the last couple of days because I've been
working on a web site for hosting explanations and citations, for showing the
current versions of charts, and for chart archives.  Now I have the section
of the site set up for the [COVID-19 Dashboard](/visualizations/covid19-dashboard/)
analysis product.  Here's the latest, with the new site branding.
