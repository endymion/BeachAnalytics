We're all watching the crowds on beaches and in Florida and elsewhere in horror.  People partying in big groups on the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, crowds of people floating on inner tubes on Lake Havasu in Arizona.  Crowds of people socializing shoulder-to-shoulder in Daytona and Arizona.  Walking the boardwalks in packs on the boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland.

But how bad is it, really?
