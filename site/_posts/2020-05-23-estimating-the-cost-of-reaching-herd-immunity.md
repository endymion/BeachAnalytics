How many people would die if we were to simply surrender to the coronavirus?

<!--more-->

When enough people have been exposed to a virus and have developed immunity,
the virus has trouble spreading because each newly-infected person is less
likely to come in contact with other vulnerable people.{% cite jhsph:what-is-herd-immunity %}  For example, measles, mumps, polio, and chickenpox were all common diseases in the United States.  But <mark>now those diseases are all rare</mark> in the US, thanks to <mark>high levels of vaccinations</mark> that have achieved herd immunity.

<div class="alert alert-info float-right see-also" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">See also</h4>
  <p>The MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella may offer some protection against COVID-19.{% cite jgold:mmr-vaccine-appears-to-confer-protection-from-covid19 %}</p>
</div>

<mark>Resistance to vaccination</mark> in the US has recently led to lapses in herd immunity protection from some of those diseases, which has led to <mark>new outbreaks of formerly-rare diseases</mark>.  For example, the 2019 outbreak of measles at Disneyland in California,{% cite wapo:2019-measles-outbreak-at-disneyland %}

## What's the threshold?

Different viruses are different.  <mark>We can't stop every virus through herd immunity</mark>.  It doesn't seem to be possible with the strain of HIV that causes AIDS.{% cite nature:no-herd-immunity-for-HIV-1 %}  And we still don't know enough about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease to be certain that herd immunity will even stop it.

For a really contagious disease like measles, 90 to 93 percent of the population
needs to develop immunity to stop the spread of infection.{% cite whoint:herd-immunity-thresholds-for-measles %}  Which explains why
it's so easy for herd immunity to lapse for measles, and why it's so easy for
new outbreaks to start when enough people reject vaccination.

For SARS-CoV-2, epidemiologists think that <mark>about 70% to 90% of the population may need
to develop immunity</mark> to have herd protection.{% cite jhsph:what-is-herd-immunity %}  But there is a caveat:

## Would it even stop at that point?

Herd immunity protects a population against new infections.  But if there is
already an outbreak in progress, then it <mark>won't immediately stop</mark> when the
proportion of infected people reaches the herd immunity threshold.{% cite nytimes:overshoot %}  An infection
that's already underway will continue to spread.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
A runaway train doesn’t stop when the track begins to slope uphill, and a rapidly spreading virus doesn’t stop right when herd immunity is attained.
<footer class="blockquote-footer">Carl T Bergstrom and Natalie Dean{% cite nytimes:overshoot %}</footer>
</blockquote>

Depending on the pace of the outbreak, the COVID-19 outbreak could <mark>continue to spread through the United States for
months after we reach the herd immunity threshold</mark>, resulting in many more
infections and many more deaths.  This concept is called "overshoot."

How many more infections?  We can't know.  It depends on too many factors, and there are too many unknowns.  But we do know that <mark>allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would make the spread faster</mark> and would result in going <mark>farther over the threshold</mark>.{% cite 538:herd-immunity-shinyapp %}

## How many people would die getting to that point?

To estimate the cost of reaching herd immunity in the United States, I'm using
the estimate that the Imperial College of London used to estimate what
would happen if the virus were to spread uncontrolled through our country.
Because <mark>that's what people are suggesting</mark> when they propose <mark>surrendering to the virus</mark> and trying to reach herd immunity by letting everyone get exposed.

Those researchers estimated that 81% of Americans would be
infected if we were to do that.{% cite imperial-collect:impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions %}  I used that same percentage to illustrate the
<mark>cost in human lives</mark> of reaching that point, based on the amount of death that we have already seen.

David Dowdy, MD, PhD, infectious disease epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins University, inspired this visualization with a
<a href="https://twitter.com/davidwdowdy/status/1260675514416664577">powerful illustration</a>.

This resulting chart illustrates that <mark>millions of people in the US could die</mark> if we were to surrender to the virus and allow it to spread freely:

The Imperial College report also includes an infection prevalence estimate for
US states.  I used that estimate and current public data from the Florida Department of Health to provide the same visualization for the state of Florida:

{% include responsive-image-article-figure.html
  image='charts/the-cost-of-herd-immunity/florida/2020-05-23.jpg' %}

Infection prevalence estimates are not available at the county level, but
an ongoing study that attempts to estimate the amount of
underreporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States.{% cite cmmid %}
I have been using their estimate of how many infections are reported as cases to estimate the number of infected people at the county and city levels, and those estimates have proven to be in-line with infection prevalence estimates from many different researchers. I used the same estimation method to provide visualization of the cost of reaching herd immunity for Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.

## Okay, so what does this mean?

Intentionally aiming at herd immunity is not the answer.  If we allow the
virus to spread uncontrolled, or if we go so far as to encourage the spread,
then the outbreak will rocket past the herd immunity threshold, and people will
continue to be infected.  And we will have more deaths for months after we reach
that point.

<mark>We <i><b>must</b></i> reduce the final death count.</mark>  The only way to do that is by <mark>lowering the fatality rate</mark> through new therapies, or by <mark>stopping the spread with a vaccine</mark>.  We must buy time for those things by limiting the spread now.  The biggest factor that affects the spread is under our control: social distancing.  Weather, overall health, and other things are all factors, but social distancing dwarfs those factors.{% cite policylab:forecasting-impacts-of-weather policylab:studying-effect-of-weather %}  We're at a point right now where we risk a second outbreak that we might not be able to control, and the best way that we have to stop it is to maintain social distancing.

This is the challenge of our lifetime.  <mark>We can't simply surrender to the virus.  Too many people who we love and who we need would die.</mark>  We must do this.  I'm aiming my visualizations here at reminding us <mark>what we're fighting for</mark>.

## Your community

If you're reading this from somewhere outside of South Florida, and you're
interested in seeing <mark>what the cost of reaching herd immunity might look like for your community</mark>, please take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/endymion/BeachAnalytics/raw/master/analysis/The%20cost%20of%20reaching%20herd%20immunity.xlsx">Excel file</a> that I used to generate these charts.  I designed it so that it's easy for you to plug in data for your area.  You'll need a population count, and if you want to go
more fine-grained than the state level, then you'll currently need to use a
confirmed case count to estimate your true infection prevalence in your area.
Please be sure to check the latest underreporting estimate from the Center
for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine{% cite cmmid %}, because they update their estimates frequently.
