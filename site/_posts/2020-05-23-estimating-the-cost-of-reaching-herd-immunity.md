How many people would die if we were to simply surrender to the coronavirus?

<!--more-->

When enough people have been exposed to a virus and have developed immunity,
the virus has trouble spreading because each newly-infected person is less
likely to come in contact with other vulnerable people.{% cite jhsph:what-is-herd-immunity %}  For example, measles, mumps, polio, and chickenpox were all common diseases in the United States.  But now those diseases are all rare,
thanks to herd immunity that the population in the US has achieved through
high levels of vaccinations.

  <h4 class="alert-heading">See also</h4>
  <p>The MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella may offer some protection against COVID-19.{% cite jgold:mmr-vaccine-appears-to-confer-protection-from-covid19 %}</p>
</div>

Resistance to vaccination in the US has recently
led to lapses in herd immunity protection from some of those diseases that have
led to new outbreaks of formerly-rare diseases.  For example, the 2019 outbreak
of measles at Disneyland in California,{% cite wapo:2019-measles-outbreak-at-disneyland %}

## What's the threshold?

Different viruses are different.  Not every virus can be stopped through herd immunity.{% cite nature:no-herd-immunity-for-HIV-1 %}  And we still don't know enough about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease to be certain that herd immunity will even stop it.

For a really contagious disease like measles, 90 to 93 percent of the population
needs to develop immunity to stop the spread of infection.{% cite whoint:herd-immunity-thresholds-for-measles %}  Which explains why
it's so easy for herd immunity to lapse for measles, and why it's so easy for
new outbreaks to start when enough people reject vaccination.

For SARS-CoV-2, epidemiologists think that about 70% of the population may need
to develop immunity to have herd protection.{% cite jhsph:what-is-herd-immunity %}  But there is a caveat:

## Would it even stop at that point?

Herd immunity protects a population against new infections.  But if there is
already an infection in progress then it won't immediately stop when the
proportion of infected people reaches the herd immunity threshold.{% cite nytimes:overshoot %}  An infection
that's already underway will continue to spread.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
A runaway train doesn’t stop the instant the track begins to slope uphill, and a rapidly spreading virus doesn’t stop right when herd immunity is attained.
<footer class="blockquote-footer">Carl T Bergstrom and Natalie Dean{% cite nytimes:overshoot %}</footer>
</blockquote>

The COVID-19 outbreak could continue to spread through the United States for
months after we reach the herd immunity threshold, resulting in many more
infections and many more deaths.  This concept is called "overshoot."

How many more?  We can't know.  It depends on too many factors and there are
too many unknowns.

## How many people would die getting to that point?

To estimate the cost of reaching herd immunity in the United States, I'm using
the estimate that the Imperial College of London used when they estimated what
would happen if the virus were to spread uncontrolled through our country.
Because that's what people are suggesting when they propose surrendering to
the virus and trying to reach herd immunity by letting everyone get exposed.
Those researchers used 81% as their estimate of how many Americans would be
infected if we were to do that.{% cite imperial-collect:impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions %}  The estimate for the number of infections
is based on the ongoing study that attempts to estimate the amount of
underreporting of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States.{% cite cmmid %}

This resulting chart illustrates that millions of people in the US could die
if we were to surrender to the virus and allow it to spread freely.
