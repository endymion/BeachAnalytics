The Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine has revised their estimated range for the ratio of overall infections to reported cases. Their range is now a lot wider than it has been over the last week or two. Their estimated range is the best idea that I have for estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections from the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

As a result, the uncertainty bands on my [charts](/visualizations/current_estimated-number-of-sarscov2-infections/current.html) for the estimated number of infections has gotten a lot wider with the most recent update. The line toward the top of the range is their best estimate that 12% of infections are reported.

Estimated infection count charts for other areas are available in the
[Estimated Number of SARS-CoV-2 Infections](/visualizations/current_estimated-number-of-sarscov2-infections/)
analysis product section.
