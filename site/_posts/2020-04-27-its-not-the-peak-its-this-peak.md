The widely-cited IHME model does _not_ forecast that the COVID-19 epidemic will peak

<!--more-->

Many people are misinterpreting the COVID-19 [forecast model](/ihme-model.html) from the University of Washingtonâ€™s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

## One key misunderstanding

There is a widespread misunderstanding at the heart of almost all of the misinformation related to the IHME model: <mark>Many people think that the IHME model is predicting 'when the epidemic will peak' and then subside before it's all over</mark>.  But that's not what the model is about.

## _THIS_ peak

The IHME model is not projecting that the epidemic will peak and subside and then it will all be over.  It's <mark>projecting when the _first wave_ will peak</mark>, assuming that social distancing stays in place.{% cite ihme:forecasting-the-impact-of-the-first-wave %}  It's a planning tool for health planners and governments to project how long before social distancing could be relaxed after _one wave_ of the epidemic.  It's not a crystal ball that's predicting what will happen with the overall pandemic.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
It is critical to note that <mark>we restrict our projections to the first wave</mark> of the pandemic under a scenario of continued implementation of social distancing mandates and <mark>do not yet incorporate the possibility of a resurgence</mark> or subsequent waves.
<footer>{% reference ihme:forecasting-the-impact-of-the-first-wave %}</footer>

## Don't watch the center line

At least two different things confuse people about the charts in the IHME reports.  One is the incorrect idea that the charts predict a single wave.  Another thing that confuses people is the center line on the projections.

During hurricane season, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center are so concerned that people will pay too much attention to the center line of the hurricane track forecast cone images{% cite bams:cone-of-uncertainty %} that they have <mark>removed the center line</mark> from the default forecast images.

The easy-to-understand center line in the IHME charts comes with the exact same problem: People are treating the model like a crystal ball and focusing on the center line.  And then they're <mark>disillusioned and they reject the whole model</mark> then the real death count doesn't track the center line exactly, or when researchers update the parameters of the model and the forecast line changes.  This stems from a tragic misunderstanding of what the model is trying to forecast and now it works.

In the worst case, people will misinterpret the IHME model's reports as saying that the threat of COVID-19 is over, and that it's okay to stop the social distancing.

## Conclusions

The IHME model is not forecasting when the COVID-19 epidemic will be over.  It isn't forecasting that there will only be one peak.

It's only trying to estimate the timing of the _current_ wave of the epidemic.  It assumes that we have taken measures to slow the spread of the virus.  And it estimates how long it might take to reduce the number of new infections to a level where social distancing could end.{% cite ihme:faq %}  Temporarily.  Future outbreaks would require a repeat of the whole mitigation cycle.

Don't focus too much on the center line of the IHME forecast charts, any more than you would assume that a hurricane will follow the center line on the NHC forecast cone images.
