<p>This chart shows the number of confirmed cases over time.</p>

<p>The raw number of cases has limited use in a lot of ways, but in the case
of this pandemic the rate of change is important.  Analysis visualizations like the
percent increase and doubling time charts focus on that rate of change.  but
sometimes it's nice to be able to see the raw numbers first.</p>

<p>The media is mostly focusing on these raw numbers.</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

The confirmed case count data comes from the
