<p>The dashboard image is a bite-sized COVID-19 news nugget, designed for social
feeds and mobile messaging.</p>

<p>The darker blue area on the top-left of the dashboard shows the number of
  confirmed COVID-19 cases for a given area, as well as the doubling time of
  the growth of the number of confirmed cases.</p>

<p>The lighter blue areas of the chart show metrics that are based on estimating
  the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, based on the number of confirmed COVID-19
  cases.</p>

<p>Another factor in the lighter-blue metrics is the estimated population for
  the area.  Please check the spreadsheet to see the latest population estimates.</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

The infection estimate in the dashboard is based on the confirmed case counts
for the city of Miami Beach in the
<a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/">daily updates</a>
from the Florida Division of Emergency Management.

Please see the <a href="/visualizations/covid19-dashboard/current.html">Current COVID-19 Dashboards</a> page for the latest dashboard
published for each area.
