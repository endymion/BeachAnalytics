The University of Texas COVID-19 model builds on the <a href="/ihme-model.html">IHME model</a> by adding real-time daily social-distancing data.{% cite UT:projections-for-first-wave %}

The UT model also differs from the IHME model by using only US data, instead of assuming that the epidemic in the US will follow the same patterns seen in other countries.  And it attempts to improve on the verifiably-wrong IHME model's uncertainty calculations.
