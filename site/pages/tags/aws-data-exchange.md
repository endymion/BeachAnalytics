The [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) is a service that makes it easy to find and use data for cloud computing.  AWS has added a clearinghouse for [Data related to COVID-19 available for Research & Development](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/covid-19/?cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.order&cards.sort-order=asc).

You can access data like the Unacast social-distancing scoreboard data through AWS{% cite awsdataexchange:unacast %}, often for free.  Systems like the [Coronavirus Tracker](https://www.domo.com/covid19/economy/#get-back-to-work) from Domo are powered by data from the exchange.  If you're trying to build a live dashboard or a model, then AWS might be one of the simplest ways to get your data.
