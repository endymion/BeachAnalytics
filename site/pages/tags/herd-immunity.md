summary: Herd immunity is not acceptable as a COVID-19 control strategy because
  the process of reaching herd immunity would be an unprecedented humanitarian
  disaster, leading to tens of millions of preventable deaths.  For all mankind,
  we must take every possible measure to prevent this from happening.

Herd immunity is a key concept in epidemiological modeling. This is the state at
which enough people are immune that a new outbreak cannot take off—because there
are no vulnerable people around for an infected person to infect, even without
mitigation such as social distancing.  Eventually, each new infected person
infects fewer than one new people.  Experts estimate that the threshold for
reaching herd immunity from COVID-19 would be when about 50% to 66% of people
have been infected.

Without a vaccine or sustained mitigation measures, herd immunity will be the
default control strategy for COVID-19.  But this would be a disaster.

## Unacceptable as a control strategy

One estimate for the herd immunity threshold, based on an R<sub>0</sub> value of
2.5 for SARS-CoV-2, is 60%.  Estimates for the infection fatality rate are
currently in the range of 0.5% to 1%.  If the population of the Earth is
currently about 7.6 billion people, then 46 million people could die worldwide
based simply on 1% of 60%. The cost in human lives makes this approach
unacceptable as an intentional strategy.  But you can't just let the infection
spread unchecked and expect to see "only" 60% infected, or "only" 46 million
deaths.

One reason is that the infection fatality rate rises when health care systems
are overrun.  The eye-opening conclusion of the Imperial College report in March
was that many more people would die without mitigation and suppression
measures.{% cite imperial-college:global-impact %}

## Overshoot

Another reason is "overshoot", a key concept about the timing of the epidemic.{% cite bergstrom:overshoot %}
When the epidemic reaches the herd immunity threshold, it doesn't immediately
stop spreading.  It has a sort of momentum.{% cite oxford:overshoot %}  You reach herd immunity at the
point when each infected person infects less than one other person, but people
are still getting infected at that point.  That point where you reach herd
immunity, perhaps 60%, is the _peak_ of the epidemic, not the _end_ of the
epidemic.

How many more infections does this overshoot represent?  It could be a lot. For
the model shown in Carl T. Bergstrom's tweet, above, the overshoot represents
nearly 30% of the population.  So, in this scenario, 90% of the people on the
planet get infected and maybe as many as 70 million die.  Or more, depending on
the effectiveness of the world's healthcare systems.

## Second-wave overshoot

Overshoot is a particularly relevant concept when exploring the prospect of a
second wave, or multiple outbreaks.  In a scenario where strong intervention measures have been
applied, a second wave is possible if the infection is reintroduced into the
population.{% cite royalsociety:multiple-outbreaks %}

<blockquote class="blockquote">
If control of the first outbreak depleted resources—such as drug stockpiles or
‘goodwill’ among the population to follow quarantine measures—the second
outbreak will be largely uncontrolled, producing a significant overshoot
<footer>{% reference oxford:overshoot %}</footer>
</blockquote>

Does that sound familiar?  Depletion of goodwill among the population to follow quarantine measures?  The result could be many more deaths in the long term.

## Conclusion

Herd immunity is the default control strategy if we can't mobilize a better
approach. But this would be unacceptable as a conscious strategy because it
would result in tens of millions of preventable deaths worldwide.  Reaching herd
immunity would require huge numbers of infections, and even more would be
infected because of overshoot.
