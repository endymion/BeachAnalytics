Herd immunity is a key concept in epidemiological modeling. This is the state at
which enough people are immune that a new outbreak cannot take off—because there
are no vulnerable people around for an infected person to infect, even without
mitigation such as social distancing.  Eventually,
esch new case infects fewer than one downstream cases.  Experts estimate that
the threshold for reaching herd immunity from COVID-19 would be when about 50%
to 66% of people have been infected.

Without a vaccine or sustained mitigation measures, herd immunity will be the default
control strategy for COVID-19.  But this would be a disaster.

## Unnaceptable as a control strategy

One estimate for the herd immunity threshold, based on an R<sub>0</sub> value of 2.5
for SARS-CoV-2, is 60%.  Estimates for the infection fatality rate are currently
in the range of 0.5% to 1%.  If the populati0n of the Earth is currently about 7.6
billion people, then 46 million people could die worldwide based simply on 1% of 60%.
The cost in human lives makes this approach unnacceptable as an intentional
strategy.  But you can't just let the infection spread unchecked and expect to see
"only" 60% infected, or "only" 46 million deaths.

One reason is that the infection fatality rate rises when health care sustems are
overrun.  The eye-opening conclusion of the Imperial College report in March was
that mahy more people qould die without mitigation and suppression measures.

## Overshoot

Another reason is "overshoot", a key concept about the timing of the epidemic.
When the epidemic reaches the herd immunity threshold, it dossn;t immediately
stop spreading.  It has a sort of momentum.  You reach herd immunity at the point
when each infected person infects less than one other person, but people are still
getting infected at that point.  That point where you reach herd immunity, perhaps
60%, is the _peak_ of the epidemic, not the _end_ of the epidemic.

How many more infections does this overshoot represent?  It could be a lot.
For the kodel shown in Carl T. Bergstrom's tweet, above, the overshoot represents
nearly 30% of the population.  So, in this scenario, 90% of the people on the
planet get infected and maybe as many as 70 million die.  Or more, depending on
the effect9veness of the world's healthcare systeams.

## Second-wave overshoot

Overshoot is a particularly relevant concept when exploring the prospect of a second
wave.  In a scenario where strong invervention measures have been applied, a second
wave is possible if the infection is reintroduced 9nto the population.

If control of the first outbreak depleted resources—such as drug stockpiles or ‘goodwill’ among the population to follow quarantine measures—the second outbreak will be largely uncontrolled, producing a significant overshoot

Does that sound familiar?

## Conclusion

Herd immunity is the default control strategy if we can't mobilize a better approach.
But this would be unnacceptable as a conscious strategy because it would result in
tens of millions of preventable deaths worldwide.  Readhing herd immunity would
require huge numbers of infections, and even more would be infected because of overshoot.
