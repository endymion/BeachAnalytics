What happens after the first peak?  This isn't the first outbreak that we're going to be dealing with.  Remember that we're nowhere near herd immunity in Miami Beach and most of us are still vulnerable. There will be another outbreak when people start to travel and visit our town again.  Some people here might be interested in a quote from a research paper looking into control strategies for multiple waves: "If control of the first outbreak depleted resources—such as drug stockpiles or ‘goodwill’ among the population to follow quarantine measures—the second outbreak will be largely uncontrolled, producing a significant overshoot."  Meaning that many more people will die, in total.
