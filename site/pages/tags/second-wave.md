This isn't the first outbreak that we're going to be dealing with.  Remember that we're nowhere near herd immunity in Miami Beach and most of us are still vulnerable. There will be another outbreak when people start to travel and visit our town again.{% cite oxford:overshoot %}

If control of the first outbreak depleted resources—such as drug stockpiles or
‘goodwill’ among the population to follow quarantine measures—the second
outbreak will be largely uncontrolled, producing a significant overshoot.

Meaning that many more people would die, in total.

White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has explicitly warned that there
is a "likelihood" of a second wave if areas of the US reopen too soon, while the

formula. The problem is if we don’t do that, there is a likelihood that we
will have a rebound.
