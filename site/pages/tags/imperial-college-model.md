summary: Arguably the most influential computer forecasting model in history,
  this model is the one that led the UK and US governments to begin mitigation measures.

The MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College of London captured the world's attention with their report in March 2020 that projected that the British healthcare system and <mark>healthcare systems around the world would be overwhelmed</mark> with COVID-19 patients unless countries immediately took aggressive measures to slow the spread of the virus.{% cite imperial-college:global-impact %}

The world faces a severe and acute public health emergency due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. How individual countries respond in the coming weeks will be critical in influencing the trajectory of national epidemics.

Their COVID-19 model is an existing model built in 2005 to study H5N1 avian
flu that they adapted to model SARS-CoV-2.{% cite nature:covid19-simulations %}  

## What does it say?

The key conclusion of the model that has had a big impact is the estimation that COVID-19 could kill 40 million people worldwide, without any intervention.  And that the number of deaths could be cut in half through mitigation to slow the spread of the virus.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
We estimate that in the absence of interventions, COVID-19 would have resulted in 7.0 billion infections and <mark>40 million deaths globally this year</mark>. Mitigation strategies focussing on shielding the elderly (60% reduction in social contacts) and slowing but not interrupting transmission (40% reduction in social contacts for wider population) <mark>could reduce this burden by half</mark>, <mark>saving 20 million lives</mark>, but we predict that even in this scenario, health systems in all countries will be quickly overwhelmed.

The report concludes the need to <mark>begin suppression strategies immediately</mark> in multiple countries in order to <mark>save tens of millions of lives</mark>.
