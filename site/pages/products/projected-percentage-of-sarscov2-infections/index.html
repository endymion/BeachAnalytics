<p>Experts estimate the critical threshold for achieving that herd protection
  for COVID-19 is between 50% and 66%.  How long will it take to get there?</p>

<p>This chart uses the same technique as
  <a href="/products/estimated-number-of-sarscov2-infections/">Estimated Number
    of SARS-CoV-2 Infections</a> to estimate the percentage of the population
    in the area that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, based on the number
    of confirmed COVID-19 cases.</a>

<h2>Sources</h2>

The confirmed case count data comes from the
<a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/">daily updates</a>
from the Florida Division of Emergency Management.

<h2>Current</h2>
