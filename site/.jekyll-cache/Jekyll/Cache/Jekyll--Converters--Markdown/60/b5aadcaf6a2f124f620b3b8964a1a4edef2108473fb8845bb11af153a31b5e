I"¨<p>The Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine has revised their estimated range for the ratio of overall infections to reported cases. Their range is now a lot wider than it has been over the last week or two. Their estimated range is the best idea that I have for estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections from the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>As a result, the uncertainty bands on my <a href="/products/current_estimated-number-of-sarscov2-infections/current.html">charts</a> for the estimated number of infections has gotten a lot wider with the most recent update. The line toward the top of the range is their best estimate that 12% of infections are reported.</p>

<p>Estimated infection count charts for other areas are available in the
<a href="/products/current_estimated-number-of-sarscov2-infections/">Estimated Number of SARS-CoV-2 Infections</a>
analysis product section.</p>
