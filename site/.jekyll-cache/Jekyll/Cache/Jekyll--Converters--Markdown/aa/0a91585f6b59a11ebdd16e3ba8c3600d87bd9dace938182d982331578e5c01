I"“<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>The Florida Department of Emergency Management releases their twice-daily updates as PDF files.  The data in those files is not easy to analyze without extracting it into a spreadsheet or a data file.  I have been pulling numbers by hand out of the PDF files into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.  Itâ€™s time-consuming and it delays my updates, and if I take a day off then the visualizations donâ€™t update themselves.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I wrote some <a href="https://github.com/endymion/BeachCov2/tree/master/data">code</a> that extracts the city-by-city data from those PDF files into a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.  I can run it periodically to get the latest updates.  Then I can use that spreadsheet directly for visualizations with Google Data Studio, or I can transform the data to other spreadsheets with Ruby or R for further analysis and use those spreadsheets in visualizations.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1us_aePT2_OQoc3iBXckrBAeYZb8j4bVAY_cr8t6V8r0/edit?usp=sharing">the spreadsheet</a> public, and Iâ€™ll update it with each new FDEM update:</p>

<p>All that I have so far is the city-by-city data, but thatâ€™s a start.  Next Iâ€™ll add the county-level data to another Google Sheets spreadsheet, and then also the Florida-wide data..</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently not using the case-by-case data in the FDEM reports, and I donâ€™t have any plans to extract that data.  Please contact me if you need that data in machine-readable form and it might help you if I did extract it.  Iâ€™d be happy to do that.</p>

<p>I still have to run this each time, but I designed all of the code to run in AWS Lambda.</p>
